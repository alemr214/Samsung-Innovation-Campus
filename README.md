# Samsung Innovation Campus

## Getting Started

You can find all exercises, practices, and resources from UDEM - Samsung viewed on the Samsung Innovation Campus certification on Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–.

### Prerequisites

For testing all scripts here you need the follow:

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)

### Installing

I recommend that you create a virtual environment and install all pip requirements that you can find in the requirements.txt file.

Create virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv/

Upgrade Pip then install all packages

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the tests

If you prefer working with Jupyter, select the virtual environment to recognize the libraries are installed.
